    <p>This blog post is completely written in a web browser running <a href="http://gitpod.io">gitpod</a>, which allows you to setup your
development environment in the cloud. And you can try it out yourself by following this link: <a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/katmatt/katmatt-blogs">katmatt/katmatt-blogs</a>.</p>
<p>If you click that link, it will open up the github project for my blog, start a <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> server and offers you to open a preview of my blog:
<figure>
    <img src="gitpod-inception.png"/> 
</figure>

This feels a bit like in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">inception</a>, where the protagonists travel from a dream to another dream. And on each level the time slows down.</p>
<p>The difference in this simile is that using gitpod accelerates your work: If you have to work on a bug fix on an old version of your project, gitpod will make sure that your development environment is set up as it was configured for that version/git ref of your project!</p>
<p>It feels like inception especially in the screenshot above: it shows you the preview of this blog post while I&rsquo;m writing it in gitpod.
I still have to get my head around it and especially working with an editor/IDE running in my web browser still feels a bit strange to me.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h1>
<p>You can open up any project that is hosted either on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">gitlab</a>, <a href="http://github.com">github</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a>
by adding the repository url to the following gitpod url <code>https://gitpod.io/#&lt;YOUR_GIT_REPO_URL&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the beginning: If you use this link for the first time, gitpod will open a wizard that helps you to setup your development environment. When you used the link to my blogs gitpod development environment, then gitpod already started a development environment for you that contains everything to write a blog post.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-development-environment">What is a development environment?</h1>
<p>I normally write my blog post on my laptop that runs ubuntu linux. I use hugo to generate my
blog from markdown files and I use github actions to publish my finalized blog to github pages: <a href="https://github.com/katmatt/katmatt-blogs/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml">katmatt-blogs/.github/workflows/main.yml</a>.</p>
<p>That means that I already set up a continuous integration build to automate everything.
But what&rsquo;s missing is a setup of my local development environment. In the case of my blog, it&rsquo;s relatively simple because I can install hugo with one command. But in a typical SW development project, I would have to setup multiple tools to build the project locally. And this setup is typically written down in prose in a readme file, needs to be updated manually, and tends to be outdated very quickly. It would be much easier if this description would be machine-readable and if a machine could precisely provision the same development environment for each team member.</p>
<h1 id="disposable-development-environments-with-gitpod">Disposable development environments with gitpod</h1>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what gitpod offers: It runs your development environment in the cloud. The gitpod team calls this concept disposable development environments.</p>
<p>And to setup such a development environment with gitpod, you have to describe your development environment in a <code>.gitpod.yml</code> file located in the root of your project.
And this <code>.gitpod.yml</code> file looks like this for my blog:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#66d9ef">image</span>: klakegg/hugo:<span style="color:#ae81ff">0.68.3</span>-ext-alpine
<span style="color:#66d9ef">tasks</span>:
  - <span style="color:#66d9ef">command</span>: hugo server --baseUrl $(gp url <span style="color:#ae81ff">1313</span>) --liveReloadPort=<span style="color:#ae81ff">443</span> --appendPort=<span style="color:#66d9ef">false</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The first line specifies the docker image that contains hugo. And on the following line, I define the task to run
when opening my development environment. And for my blog I just need to run the hugo server command to be able to see a preview of my blog in gitpod.
This command is a bit more complex because we have to call the gitpod CLI tool <code>gp</code> to get the url where our hugo server is running and because gitpod
uses https for serving the content, we also have to set the <code>liveReloadPort</code> argument.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>My small example just scratches the surface of what gitpod offers. And the gitpod team developed their awesome product by using gitpod themselves -
an idea that is very common for SW tool companies and is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">eating your own dog food</a>.</p>
<p>And they shared how they develop gitpod in gitpod in this great video:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFMpXUsJcGM" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
</p>
<p>Although I initially had some issues with having my IDE in the browser, I now see a lot of potential: Our team reviews pull request on github by using the builtin diff view. And I seldomly checkout a PR branch, although it would provide much more context. Imagine you just click a link and then the development environment for that branch/PR immediately opens in your browser. And you can navigate the source code, run tests and may even be able to run the system under development.</p>
<p>gitpod is a game-changer and I highly recommend you to give it a try yourself!</p>
